//show only file name: dir/b
//display hidden file: dir /a:h

2. Status: tells the status of git
syntax: git status
Staus list: a. Untracked: (U)
            b. Modified: (M)
            c. Staged: means ready to be committed (ie. we added but didn't committed.)
            d. Unmodified:

//if you changes something on the readme file the it shows M in file name

//whenever you changes you need to add and commit
3. Add command: it adds new or changed file in your 
                working directory to the Git Staging area.

=> git remote add origin <-link->
=> git remote -v (to check/verify remote)
=> git branch (to check on which branch we are)
=> git branch -M main (to rename branch)
=> git push origin main  //we can also use "git push -u origin main" by the help of this we can directly write "git push"
